            About me
        </h1>
        <p>I graduated in July 2023. Most of my early experience lies in exploring data with <skills>Python and Pandas
            </skills> different
            datasets.
        </p>
        <p>I shifted my focus towards learning data science and machine learning. But I felt one dimensional and stuck
            in a jupyter notebook. Feeling strongly that I miss a lot of knowledge I ventured towards <skills>SQL, Power
                BI,
                Django and D3</skills> to be more rounded and to establish stronger building blocks for my future.
        </p>
        <p>I am currently looking for job opportunities. I am willing to work, and more importantly to learn and I'm
            very passionate. If you want to get in touch you can do so by email at <email>danvas011@gmail.com</email>
